# A Snake Game
The legendary Snake Game recreated with Python using Tkinter library.

Be a snake.  
Eat some food  
Grow in length.  
Infinite replayability.  

Besides classical Snake variant some additional game options were implemented:
| ![Classic Snake](/screenshots/Snake-demo1.png)| ![More food.](/screenshots/Snake-demo2.png)  |
|---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
|Classic snake                                  | More game options such as plentitude of food.|  
    

## Requirements
Python 3.x<br/>
Pillow==8.1.0

## Know issues
**Windows:**  
After the first game, at the start the game is unresponsive to commands. This is a "feature" of tkinter itself, and caused by the new window not being in focus.
