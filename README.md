# A Snake Game
The legendary Snake Game recreated with Python using tkinter library.

Based on Teclado tutorial: ![How to recreate the Snake game with Python!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB1aSBM8fvI)
  
   
Besides classical Snake variant some additional game options were implemented:
| ![Classic Snake](/screenshots/Snake-demo1.png)| ![More food.](/screenshots/Snake-demo2.png)  |
|---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
|Classic snake                                  | More game options such as plentitude of food.|  
    
Main point of the additional options was to later allow fine tuning the training of an AI to play the game.

# Know issues
**Windows:**  
After the first game, at the start the game is unresponsive to commands. This is a "feature" of tkinter itself, and caused by the new window not being in focus.
As the game was intented to be interacted by an AI rather than human user, this is not considered big issue.
